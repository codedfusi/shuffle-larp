# shuffle-larp

A tiny userscript to LARP your balance on [shuffle.com](https://shuffle.com) — replaces `ARS` with `$` and updates the peso icon to a USD one, so you can fake wealth.

## 🌀 What It Does

- Larps `"ARS"` Currency and changes it to `USD` or `"$"` across the site
- Also larps currency icons
- Keeps doing it even if the site re-renders (React-safe)

## 🛠 Install

2. Add the script manually or use the greasyfork script heh: https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/543360-xd2shuffle

4. Change your fiat currency to `ARS` in `SETTINGS -> PREFERENCES -> Fiat Currency`
5. `$`
